          <p>
            <i>Intermediality</i> in the sense of
            <strong>medial transposition</strong> (as for example
            <a href="#film-adaptation">film adaptation</a>,
            <a href="#novelization">novelization</a>, and
            <a href="#ekphrasis">ekphrasis</a>), has to do with the
            transformation of a given media product (a text, a film, etc.) or of
            its substratum into another medium. This category is a
            product-oriented, genetic conception of intermediality, in which the
            original text is the source of the newly formed media product, whose
            formation is based on a media-specific and obligatory intermedial
            transformation process. (Rajewsky 2005).

          <h2 id="film-adaptation">Film Adaptation</h2>
          <p>
            Film and literature have a strong relationship about many years
            during the history of cinema. It has been believed that adaptation
            is the interpretation of the original text as mirror, derivative or
            secondary production. Film is the appearance of connection between
            literature and cinema. Literature needs words to express about
            feelings and issues of community, cinema needs devices and
            techniques to be applied to produce film to be closer to audience
            and people. Literature is the art of expression; cinema is actually
            considered the universal art in which it unifies a large number of
            interested people. Some critics believe that literature inspires
            cinematic works, and sometimes it is inspired by cinema (Alnajm
            2017).

          <h2 id="ekphrasis">Ekphrasis</h2>
          <p>
            Mid 17th century: via Latin from Greek
            <i>ekphrasis</i> ‘description’, from <i>ekphrazein</i> ‘recount’,
            from <i>ek-</i> ‘out’ + <i>phrazein</i> ‘tell’. It is he description
            in prose or poetry of a visual work of art, such as painting, a
            sculpture, or even a photograph.
