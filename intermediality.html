          <p>
            It is a term for all those phenomena that in some way take place
            between media.

            The transdisciplinary discourse on intermediality incorporates the
            traditions of Interarts Studies and discussions about it within the
            disciplines of Media Studies as well as investigations into the New
            Media Poetries, which are based on digital media. The need to
            recognize “Interart Studies as
            <i>"Intermediality</i> Studies” arose as much from the perception
            that there had been a gradual change in the theoretical orientation
            and practices of interdisciplinary discourse as well as the
            approximation between the areas of Interart Studies and Media
            Studies. We should understand <i>intermediality</i> as a
            comprehensive phenomenon that includes all relations and all topics
            and subjects traditionally investigated by Interart Studies.
            <a href="media-combination.html">Media combination</a> and
            <a href="media-transposition.html">media transposition</a> are
            certainly central topics among the studies of
            <i>intermediality</i> (Clüver 2008).
